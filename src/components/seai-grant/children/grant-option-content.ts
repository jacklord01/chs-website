                  <p>
                    Homeowners and private landlords often choose to manage
                    their own home energy upgrades. This gives them the
                    flexibility to take a step-by-step approach, carrying out
                    different upgrades over time and to suit their budgets. With
                    this grant route, homeowners select a SEAI registered
                    contractor and apply for a grant through our easy-to-use
                    online application system. The grant is paid directly to the
                    homeowner, once works have been completed and grant
                    paperwork submitted.

					All homeowners, including landlords whose homes were built and

					electricity meter was installed. Grant funding can only be issued once
					per property for each type of works. This means that any property that
					previously availed of a wall insulation grant via the Better Energy
					Homes scheme or any other government scheme cannot receive additional
					support for further wall insulation works.

				<h4 class="title">Before you apply</h4>
				<p class="!p-0">
					<b>Building Regulations (Part L)</b>
				</p>
				<p class="!pb-2">
					Part L of the Building Regulations require that after any alteration

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your home achieves a minimum B2 BER rating</li>
					<li>
						your heating system and attic insulation comply with the Building
						Regulation standards
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you are applying for an SEAI grant for External or Internal Wall
					Insulation you are required to comply with these Building Regulations
					as a condition of your grant payment.

				<p class="!p-0">
					<b>Planning considerations</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					In some cases, External Insulation may require planning permission.
					For example, with protected structures, in architectural conservation
					areas or where the works result in an alteration to the front profile
					of the property. Please check with your registered contractor or local
					planning authority. Planning permission is not required for internal
					or cavity insulation.
